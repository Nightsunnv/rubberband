## Bug reports

We welcome and encourage bug reports for the Rubber Band
Library. We're happy to receive them by almost any channel. The most
usual are [as Github issues](https://github.com/breakfastquay/rubberband/issues)
or [by contacting us directly](https://breakfastquay.com/contact.html).

Please try to provide enough information for us to reproduce the
problem. At the minimum this includes details of platform, compiler,
and library configuration, as well as a description of the expected
and problematic behaviour. We appreciate that describing issues
relating to audio output can be tricky, and we may ask you to send or
provide further information such as audio examples.

## Pull requests

Github pull requests may be appropriate if you have small fixes, such
as fixes to the build system or documentation, that would be
convenient to upstream. We will gratefully read and consider PRs and
consider applying changes of this sort.

However, please be aware that we cannot directly merge pull
requests. This is partly for technical reasons (the Github repository
for the library is a read-only mirror of an upstream repo) and partly
for reasons of copyright and relicensing.

If you have any more substantial changes you would like to see
included, please contact us directly to discuss.
